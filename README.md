#Instructions

This is a basic word-guess game built using JavaScript and styled using CSS. Clicking on the letter buttons will either reveal a correct letter guess (and the button will flash green), or the button will turn red and you will lose a guess. You have ten guesses to correctly identify the fruit and win!
